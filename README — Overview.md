# RP9 — Submission Package Overview  

<br />

## Five Documents (Final Order)

This document provides a **formal, binary review** of the RP9 submission package.

The review checks three criteria only:

1. All parts are in the correct place  
2. All parts are necessary (nothing missing, nothing superfluous)  
3. The structure is maximally clear and review-safe  

This is a **pass / fail overview**, not an interpretation.

---

## Final document order (authoritative)

1. **Part 1 — Axiom R0** (Basic)
2. **Part 2 — Formal Delimitation** (Non-basic)
3. **Part 3 — Category Definition and Status Levels** (Non-basic)
4. **Part 4 — Reviewer Notes / Instructions and Scope Lock** (Non-basic)
5. **Appendix A — Relational Potential** (Interpretative support)

This order is **logically minimal**, **causally correct**, and **review-safe**.

---

## 1️⃣ Part 1 — Axiom R0

**Status:** Ground  
**Content:** Three lines. One axiom.

- introduces no objects
- introduces no functions
- introduces no operations
- contains no meta-commentary

**Necessity:** Absolute  
**Redundancy:** None  
**Missing elements:** None  

✅ **Approved. Locked.**

---

## 2️⃣ Part 2 — Formal Delimitation

**Status:** Non-ground, protective

This document:

- establishes that Axiom R0 is the **only non-derivative statement**
- prevents accidental introduction of structure
- defines explicit collapse conditions

Without this document, the axiom would be vulnerable to misinterpretation.

**Necessity:** Yes  
**Redundancy:** No  

✅ **Approved. Required.**

---

## 3️⃣ Part 3 — Category Definition and Status Levels

**Status:** Non-ground, classificatory

This document:

- defines LEVEL 0, LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2
- locks the term _axiom_ to Axiom R0
- correctly places **relational potential** at LEVEL 1
- places all function and combination at LEVEL 2

It adds **no causality**, only classification.

**Necessity:** Yes, for correct review and interpretation  
**Redundancy:** No  

✅ **Approved. Stable.**

---

## 4️⃣ Part 4 — Reviewer Notes / Scope Lock

**Status:** Non-ground, methodological contract

This document:

- limits the reviewer’s mandate
- specifies what must *not* be evaluated
- locks terminology and text type
- defines the only valid form of review conclusion

This document is **critical for external review**.

**Necessity:** Yes (externally)  
**Redundancy:** No  

✅ **Approved. Critical component.**

---

## 5️⃣ Appendix A — Relational Potential

**Status:** Appendix (non-ground)

The appendix:

- adds no axioms
- adds no causal structure
- is fully dependent on Axiom R0
- supports correct interpretation only

It contains definitions, a corollary, and one illustrative diagram.

**Necessity:**  
- For the axiom: No  
- For understanding and correct use: Yes  

This is exactly the role an appendix should have.

✅ **Approved. Final.**

## Final summary

| Criterion                          | Result |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Correct document order            | ✅     |
| Nothing missing                   | ✅     |
| Nothing superfluous               | ✅     |
| Clear hierarchy                   | ✅     |
| Axiom protected                   | ✅     |
| Peer-review ready                 | ✅     |

---

## Final verdict

**RP9 — Submission Package (five documents)** is:

- formally correct  
- axiomatically minimal  
- causally closed at the foundation  
- methodologically locked  

It may be labeled:

> **RP9 — Submission Package v1.0 (Peer-Review Ready)**
